# My Solution

| Customers  |  |
|--|--|
| pk  | Customer ID |
|   | First name |
|   | Last name |

| Orders|  |
|--|--|
| pk  | Order ID |
| fk  | Customer ID |
|   | Date of order |
|   | Order quantity |
|   | To address |

| Orders|  |
|--|--|
| pk | Date of inventory |
| fk  | Customer ID |
|   | Quantity in inventory |
|   | Selling price of product |

| Inventory|  |
|--|--|
| pk | Product ID |
|  | Quantity of Inventory |
|   | Quantity in inventory |
|   | Buying price of product |

When a customer makes an order, the system checks whether the there is sufficient stocks in the inventory by checking "Quantity in inventory" in the products entity . If true, then proceed with order, else, it would alert the customer there is no stocks available. Then, the system then will check the "Date of inventory" for the oldest standing invertory and process this first before the others. The price deiffence between "Selling price of product" and "Buying price of product" will determine how much profit the company makes.
